# Step 1: Annotation
# Annotate variants with additional information such as gene names, variant effects, conservation scores, and functional predictions.
# Tools like ANNOVAR, VEP (Variant Effect Predictor), or SnpEff can be used for annotation.

# Step 2: Filtering
# Apply additional filters to the variants to remove potential false positives or low-confidence variants based on criteria such as quality, read depth, allele frequency, or functional annotations.
# Tools like GATK VariantFiltration, BCFtools, or custom scripts can be used for filtering.

# Step 3: Prioritization
# Prioritize the variants based on specific study goals or research questions.
# Consider factors such as variant frequency, predicted functional impact, clinical significance, or presence in known variant databases.

# Step 4: Pathogenicity Assessment
# Assess the pathogenicity or disease relevance of the variants, particularly in the context of clinical or genetic studies.
# Refer to variant databases (e.g., ClinVar, HGMD), disease-specific databases, or use specific prediction tools for disease-associated variants.

# Step 5: Functional Analysis
# Perform functional analysis to explore the potential impact of variants.
# This can involve examining gene expression data, protein-protein interactions, regulatory elements, or conducting functional studies.

# Step 6: Population and Inheritance Analysis
# Analyze the frequency of variants in different populations and assess whether they follow expected inheritance patterns (e.g., autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked).
# Tools like PLINK, GEMINI, or custom scripts can be used for population and inheritance analysis.

# Step 7: Visualization and Reporting
# Visualize the variants and analysis results using tools such as genome browsers (e.g., IGV, UCSC Genome Browser), variant visualization tools (e.g., VarSome, Alamut), or custom scripts.
# Generate reports summarizing the variant analysis, including relevant findings, interpretation, and supporting evidence.

# Step 8: Data Sharing and Collaboration
# Share the variant data, annotations, and analysis results with collaborators, databases, or public repositories to contribute to the broader scientific community and enable further research and data integration.
